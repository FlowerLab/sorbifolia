## Things to remember

1. üí° **Please mark the Pull Request as a `draft` if it is not ready.**\
   In other words, when it still is a work in progress _(WIP)_.\
   List your TODO list, so other contributors can help you speed it up.

2. ‚ùó **Any Pull Request title needs to follow our Git commits messages
   convention.**\
   We're using the _"Squash and merge"_ strategy, so what matters the most to us
   is the title.

## Git commits messages convention

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
